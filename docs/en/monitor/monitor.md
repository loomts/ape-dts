# Monitoring info
Counters are used to record the task status, they will be periodically logged in monitor.log (configuration: [pipeline] checkpoint_interval_secs).

# Time window counters
This type of counter is an array of sub-counters. During task execution, whenever there is a state change (e.g., successfully writing a batch entries to target), a new sub-counter is generated to record the increment info (e.g., number of entries written to target).

- The counter has a time window (configuration: [pipeline] counter_time_window_secs), expired sub-counters will be discarded.
- The counter is used for real-time monitoring, such as the number of synchronized entries in time window.
- The counter has aggregation algorithms, such as the average count of synchronized entries per second.

## Aggregation algorithms

| Aggregation | Description | Example |
| :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | 
| sum | sum of sub-counters | count of synchronized entries in last 10 seconds |
| avg | sum of sub-counters / number of sub-counters | average time cost for each write to target in last 10 seconds |
| avg_by_sec | sum of all sub-counters / time window | average number of entries written to target per second in last 10 seconds |
| max | the sub-counter with the maximum value | maximum number of entries written to target in a single batch in last 10 seconds |
| max_by_sec | sums the sub-counters for each second, and finds the second with the maximum sum | Maximum number of entries written to target in a single second |

# No window counter

A simple counter to record accumulated data, such as the number of migrated MySQL records.

## Aggregation algorithms

| Aggregation | Description | Example |
| :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| latest | Current value | Number of synchronized data entries by the task |
